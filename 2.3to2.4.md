## Upgrade from 2.3 to 2.4

This document shows you how to upgrade HortusFox from 2.3 to 2.4.

## General upgrade steps
The following files and folders have to be replaced:
```
/app
/public/css
/public/js
```

## Version specific upgrade steps

You can also upgrade the installer. Therefore update the following folder with all files
```
/public/installer
```

The docker files have been updated
```
.dockerignore
dockerfile
docker-compose.yml
docker-entrypoint.sh
```

A new table `SessionModel` was created to allow multi-device logins
```sql
id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
userId INT NOT NULL
session VARCHAR(512) NOT NULL
status BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
```

Two columns of the `UserModel` table got dropped in favor of SessionModel
```sql
session
status
```

The theme data file `layout.json` got renamed to `theme.json`. 
Also the theme definition file needs to provide the following attributes:
```json
"author": "Name of the author",
"version": "Theme version, e.g. 1.0",
"contact": "Contact info, e.g. e-mail or website"
```
