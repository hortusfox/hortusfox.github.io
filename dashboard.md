### Unhealthy plants & locations
If you have any unhealthy plants, they will show up in this section. If not you will get informed that everything seems to be fine.
Down below you will find a list of all locations that are configured in the database. All plants are subject to a specific location
of your environment. Before adding any plants you need to setup these locations in the database.
