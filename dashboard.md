## Dashboard

The dashboard provides you with an overview of various important information. The following information are available:

### Statistics
The statistics give you an overview of some numbers in your workspace.

### Locations
In this section you will see your locations. Plants have to be assigned to locations, so in order to see the list of plants
of a specific location you can just navigate to it via the dashboard. Alternatively you can also use the navbar menu to quickly
navigate to a location regardless what page you are currently viewing.
