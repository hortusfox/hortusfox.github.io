### Locations
In this section you will see your locations. Plants have to be assigned to locations, so in order to see the list of plants
of a specific location you can just navigate to it via the dashboard. Alternatively you can also use the navbar menu to quickly
navigate to a location regardless what page you are currently viewing.

### Log
The log shows the recent history of actions performed by all users. You can toggle if you want to see this log in your <a href="profile.md">preferences</a>. Most log entries are linked to the object it refers to, so you can click/tap on them.
