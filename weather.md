## Weather

There is a weather feature available that uses OpenWeatherMap. This way you can enable both a weather
widget in the index dashboard that shows the current weather as well as a forecast page that displays
the weather forecast for the next five days. In order for it to work you need to create an account on
OpenWeatherMap and acquire an API key. Then you can add your API key in the admin dashboard as well as
the latitude and longitude of your location you want the weather data from.

The weather feature is especially useful if you manage outdoor plants or garden plants.
