## Upgrade from 1.4 to 1.5

This document shows you how to upgrade HortusFox from 1.4 to 1.5.

## General upgrade steps
The following files and folders have to be replaced:
```
/app
/public/css
/public/js
```

## Version specific upgrade steps
You can add this to your .env
```sh
APP_OVERLAYALPHA=null
```

The following images need to be added
```
/public/img/partypopper.png
/public/img/plantsempty.png
```

You can also upgrade the installer. Therefore update the following folder with all files
```
/public/installer
```

The model and migration OverdueInfoModel have been renamed in order to be more general and handle multiple situations.
Therefore the table overdueinfo needs to be renamed to 
```
taskinformer
```
Also there is a new column added
```sql
what VARCHAR(512) NOT NULL
```

The user table needs to be updated to reflect the latest changes. The column <i>notify_overdue_tasks</i> is removed and the following
columns are added:
```sql
notify_tasks_overdue BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
notify_tasks_tomorrow BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
```

The cronjob to deal with overdue tasks has a new route:
```
GET /cronjob/tasks/overdue?cronpw={your-token-here}
```
There is also a new cronjob available to inform users about tasks that are due tomorrow
```
GET /cronjob/tasks/tomorrow?cronpw={your-token-here}
```

Additionally you might want to update your dependencies.
